### ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
This a sport bet site, built on React, Redux $ Firebase, on this project i tried to make similar/simulate 
what its like on most bet sites out there, on this app you can creates an account, fund account, 
book games or place a real bet, withdraw earning, and view transaction history.

If you book a bet, a code is generated and any user who has the code can access the booked games, 
while if a user place a bet, a code is also generated, and all your placed bets can be seen in MY BET section.

To fund account, a user must first create a 4 digit code at the SETTINGS section in the dropdown at the header nav,
this code will be required for both payment $ withdrawal.

A user's can view a breakdown of transction history at the TRANSACTION section on the header nav, and more.

in the future i hope to make this site come alive by consuming real data(league fixture & thier outcome & live scores) 
from an sport dedicated API since currently this site uses an handwritten json data format, and has no way to decide 
if a placed bet is won or lost.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
